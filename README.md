# Sentiment Analysis Project

Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis project! This project aims to build a machine learning model that can analyze and classify the sentiment of text data. The project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to determine whether the sentiment of a given text is positive, negative, or neutral.

## Introduction

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a technique used to determine the emotional tone behind words. It is widely used in various applications such as customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and market research. This project builds a sentiment analysis model using Python and popular NLP libraries.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and vectorization.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementations of various models including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and LSTM.
- **Evaluation**: Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Prediction**: Classify new text inputs into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Basic knowledge of machine learning and natural language processing

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis.git
   cd sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Load and Preprocess Data**: Prepare your dataset by loading and preprocessing text data.

2. **Train the Model**: Train the sentiment analysis model using the preprocessed data.

3. **Evaluate the Model**: Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics.

4. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to classify new text inputs.

Detailed instructions for each step are provided in the `sentiment_analysis.ipynb` notebook.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/), which contains 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative. You can also use other sentiment analysis datasets such as the [Sentiment140 Dataset](http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students/) or [Twitter US Airline Sentiment Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment).

## Model Architecture

The project implements several machine learning models for sentiment analysis:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network

Each model is evaluated to determine the best performing one for sentiment classification.

## Results

The model achieves high accuracy in classifying the sentiment of text data. Detailed results, including training and validation accuracy/loss plots and evaluation metrics, are provided in the notebook.
